    USES : 
    Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides with applications : <br>
    agriculture, forestry, industrial weed control, lawn, garden, and aquatic environments.<br>
     Sites with the largest glyphosate use include soybeans, field corn, pasture and hay.

    <p class="header">Why is it an advantage to make plants resistant to glyphosate?</p>
This glyphosate resistance enables farmers to wipe out most weeds from the fields without damaging their crops.<br> 
Glyphosate inhibits plant growth by blocking an enzyme known as EPSP synthase,

Roundup, can trigger loss of biodiversity, making ecosystems more vulnerable to pollution and climate change,<br> 
glyphosate may cause eye or skin irritation.
